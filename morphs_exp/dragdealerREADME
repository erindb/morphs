AFTER you show the slide and the container for the dragdealer, you need to
initialize the dragdealer with:
  var mySlider = new Dragdealer('my-slider');
it WON'T WORK IF YOU DO IT BEFORE!!!

you MUST COPY the contents of dragdealer.css into the style.css that you're
using (or say that you're using dragdealer.css in some other way.......)
otherwise nothing but the text will display.
